/**
 * @fileoverview Global test setup for Codeman tests
 *
 * SAFETY: The suite gets a temporary HOME and explicitly enables runtime test
 * mode before application modules load. Tests therefore cannot touch the real
 * Codeman state/cases tree or launch external tmux-backed agent sessions.
 *
 * This setup file strips shell-level auth configuration that can leak from a
 * running Codeman instance, then handles mock/timer cleanup between tests.
